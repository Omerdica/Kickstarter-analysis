# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
-	We are tasked with sorting raw data, plotting it and creating charts to help Louise assess ideal time and budget to launch her project. 
### Purpose
-	The purpose of this study was to determine the potential outcomes based on timing and/or budget. The overall purpose of such a study is to determine the success rate and potentially determine future 
show times, or the amounts that should be spent on a production.  Data collected was sorted by months or set goals for the budget for the project.  We are tasked with figuring out when Louise should launch 
to stay within her budget.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
-	When looking at the data provided in the outcomes based on launch date, we see that only three 
months of the year had the most success. While April and August were trailing very close their failed and canceled were very high compared to some of the other months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 
-	As we look at the percentage the best performing plays were under the 1000-dollar goal.  Based on Louiseâ€™s budget her play has about 50% chance of reaching her set goal for the play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-	One of the biggest challenges that we faced during this study was trying to separate the amount of 
data. Being provided with so much data can be very confusing and can be very misleading as so many 
categories and subcategories were introduced in this project.  
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- Louise does not want to launch in December because the failure rate is the highest, but she does want to launch in May or June. 
- Looking at the numbers can be misleading because there is a different grand total of launces each month is different and varies significantly 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 -  Success rate is significantly higher in plays that had a goal under $5,000.00   and there is not enough data for over $20,000 productions.  The percentages are extreme because the number of productions/plays is very low.
- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
-  In the outcomes based on launch date we should have used percentage formula to better understand just how close some the moths were. 
-  Adding months to the dollar amount graph would have provided further breakdown of the data
